description: >
  My academic background as a Computer Engineer, combined with my years of experience working in various industries, makes me a versatile individual capable of contributing to the development of a wide range of products. Currently, I am primarily focused on full-stack development, using Flutter as the primary framework for the front-end and Django for the back-end, along with several other essential technologies such as PostgreSQL, memcache, Celery, Nginx, Docker, etc.
itemize:
  - Open to any length contract
  - Open to freelance projects
  - No problem if I need to expand the technologies I work with
