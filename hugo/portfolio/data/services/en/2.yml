title: Open to work as a contractor or freelance
description: >
  My academic background as a Computer Engineer, along with my years of experience working in the industry in all kinds of companies, make me a versatile person capable of getting involved in the development of a wide variety of products. Currently, I am more focused on full-stack development, using Flutter as the basic framework for the front-end and Django for the back-end, in addition to many other basic technologies such as PostgreSQL, memcache, Celery, Nginx, Docker, etc.
itemize:
  - Open to any length contract
  - Open to freelance projects
  - No problem if I have to expand the technologies I handle
